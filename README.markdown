PrivateSky core GitHub public repository. Based on Axiologic's work on a new execution engine for swarms.
Still very beta, for the next months this reposity will be used for coordination between partners.

How should be used for third party applications or by external contributors :
- clone it
- add your list of modules and libraries in release or in other folder
- run the build system
- execute engine/launcher.js


For security and code quality reasons all the integration here and releases will be performed manually by a very small core of developers (Sinica and Cosmin)!


The main releases will be merged periodically here, the active developement stays here:  https://github.com/PrivateSky/privatesky

The documentation is not ready for public but if you want access,please send an email to abss@axiologic.ro 

Current Release: 0.1.0 (Unstable)
