# PrivateSky

The PrivateSKY platform is the result of more then 7 years of intense research in areas of distributed systems, integration, programming languages, blockchain. 
PrivateSky propose a series of major innovations compared with these mainstream blockchains:
 - Programming with executable choreographies: the whole architecture is implemented with a  programming model based on executable choreographies. Choreographies can be used to implement a new type of smart contracts called Choreographic Smart Contracts and Secret Smart Contracts. It provides support for smart contracts, DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), crypto-tokens, etc. being an easy-to-use technology for consortia, firms, states, towns and other smaller or larger communities organized in the form of DAO's. 
 - PrivateSky maintains the SwarmESB characteristics as an integration technology (based on the creation of microservices), but also allows the implementation of serverless cloud applications. 
 - The PrivateSky technology focus on storing private data. PrivateSky works toward implementing the idea of "data self-sovereignty" : the user has full control over his data, which automatically leads to compliance with GDPR and other laws and reguation related to the security and protection of private data. 
 - We have created a performant consensus algorithm tailored for private blockchains: we put more emphasis on technical performance and scalability under normal and less on anti-censorship requirements that require Proof of Work. 
 - PrivateSky propose the hierarchical blockchains architecture as the backbone of the future internet architecture based on blockchains: PrivateSky is designed to develop as many separate, but interoperable blockchains as possible, in the same way as different websites and Web applications can easily transfer information between them.  PrivateSky comes through design with the following development levels: address representation and name resolution, identity, authorization, data storage "tamper”, serverless processing, smart contract processing.
 - PrivateSky created advanced technologies for off chain (we call them near chain) storage.
 
 Overall, PrivateSky is usable for both public and private blockchains and it is focused on providing new and powerfull tools regarding privacy and confidentiality. PrivateSky introduces a new approach on programming smart contracts based on executable choreographies.
The concept of swarm based executable choreographies is not very mainstream and we will shortly explain bellow. This whitepaper is not indented for the technical audience that is invited to study our code and technical documentation here: http://github.com/privateSky

We have to mention that swarm based executable choreographies are a novel method we have invented to implement multi-party computation and for doing integration in complex software systems.

PrivateSky improves the SwarmESB open source project. PrivateSky is funded by a European grant of 3 million Euro between 2015-2020. Other European or European business projects use code or are based on PrivateSky and SwarmESB. Among the biggest research projects that share code with PrivateSky we have to mention OPERANDO and WeldGalaxy.

Overall, using smart contracts based on executable choreographies, PrivateSky promises a natural transition from centralized, microservice-based applications to a totally decentralized blockchain-based architecture. Basically, a project can be initially written in a centralized and gradually, with the reuse of the code, to introduce the elements necessary for complete decentralization.  

The support for secret smart contacts in PrivateSky  is using methods to achieve  self-sovereign storage, encrypted choreographies, multi-party computation, quantum resistant digital signatures, homomorphic encryption, zero knowledge proof, indistinguishability obfuscation, time-locked secrets, semantic analysis on data stored in blockchains and many other techniques required to conceal and restrict the exposure of private data manipulated by smart contracts.

Until December 2019 we plan to release a public whitepaper about PrivateSKy!

## Building and running

How should be used for third party applications or by external contributors:
- clone it
- read or wiki for documentation:  [How to Web](https://github.com/PrivateSky/privatesky/wiki/How-to-web)

- add your list of modules and libraries in release or in other folder (build-devel.js)
- Enjoy the combined world of microservices, adnvanced privacy tehnology and blockchain!


Read our Wiki!


### Temporary precautions
- if running on Windows enable/grant symlink option/permissions

For security and code quality reasons all the integration here and releases will be performed manually by a very small core of developers (mainly Sinica and Cosmin)!

The stable releases will be merged periodically  [here](https://github.com/Axiologic/swarm-engine) or will be branched.
[PrivateSky](https://github.com/PrivateSky/privatesky)  is unstable and is developed in master branch. Use it just as a preview for the newer releases.

The documentation is not ready for public (only for partners)  but if you want access, please send an email to abss@axiologic.net

Current Release: 0.9.0 (Unstable and incomplete - is a preview for the the whole architecture ) The next public release (0.9.5 ) is scheduled for December 2018 and will contain the all main features. This release is for partener companies to coordinate communication, do not use in production!

### Notes

PrivateSky core GitHub public repository. Based on Axiologic's work on a new execution engine for swarms.
Still very beta, for the next months this repository will be used for coordination between partners.
